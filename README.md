# 🚗 2D Console-Based Race Car Game in C++

A simple yet engaging console-based 2D race car game built using **C++** and fundamental **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)**. Designed to run in the terminal, this project showcases the power of basic programming concepts to create an interactive gaming experience.

---

## 🎮 Game Features

- ASCII-based 2D racing environment in the terminal
- Player-controlled race car with keyboard inputs
- Random obstacle generation using queue and array logic
- Real-time collision detection
- Increasing difficulty with time/speed
- Score tracking

---

## 🧠 Concepts Used

This project integrates several data structures and programming concepts:

- Arrays for track and screen rendering
- Queues/Linked Lists for obstacle management
- Looping and control structures for game mechanics
- Basic OOP principles (Classes, Objects)
- Real-time input handling in a console environment

---

## 🛠️ Technologies

- **Language:** C++
- **Data Structures:** Arrays, Linked Lists, Queues
- **Environment:** Console/Terminal
- **Compiler:** g++, MinGW, or any standard C++ compiler
